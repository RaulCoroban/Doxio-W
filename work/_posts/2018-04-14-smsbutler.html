<p>Too busy to respond to a text? SMS Butler might help you let people know that you are not available.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://material.io/design/">Material Design</a>, the app offers a chat-like interface to schedule messages and also prepare default responses just in case you don't have time to answer messages (or don't feel like doing it). </p>
