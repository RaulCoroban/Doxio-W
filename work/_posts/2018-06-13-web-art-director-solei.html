<p>Svitlana's work and trajectory are displayed on <a href="http://adsolei.com">website</a> for the public to admire her talent. Recently, she has refreshed her site's look with a new landing page. </p>

<h2>The icons</h2>
<p>Each of the icons is responsible for representing the meaning of the section. 4 divisions? 4 matching icons flavoured with a glowing yellow: </p>
<ul>
	<li>One great look for the <i>Story</i></li>
	<li>A puzzling one for <i>Solutions</i></li>
	<li>On-spot material for <i>Stills</i></li>
	<li>Millimetric tools for <i>Side Projects</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>The colors</h2>
<p><a href="http://html-color.org/EDE14A">Yellow</a> is the color of the sun. Of freshness. Of positivity. Of energy. And it contrasts perfectly alongside with a dark <a href="http://html-color.org/363636">deep grey</a> over a immaculate white.</p>
