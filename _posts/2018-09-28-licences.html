<p>All the interfaces/designs shown in this webpage have been developed for a specific User or event. In order to display them nicely and build a portfolio you may have noticed there are some hardware elements, moslty iPhones, iPads... and also graphic ones (honeslty I don't have time and energy to take such great photos). All these elements have been downloaded from free resorces:</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<ul>iPad PRO Mockups - <a href="https://www.mockupworld.co/free/ipad-pro-from-top-view-mockup/">Mockupworld</a> </ul>
<ul>iPhone X Mockups - <a href="https://www.mockupworld.co/free/front-view-iphone-x-mockup/">Mockupworld</a> </ul>
<ul>MacBook PRO - <a href="https://www.mockupworld.co/free/clean-macbook-pro-with-touch-bar-mockup/">Mockupworld</a> </ul>

<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>There are so many images and icons in my concepts that it would drive me crazy to find them all in order to give proper reference. What I can tell you is that they come from many talented artists that usually upload their work in these websites:</p>

<ul>Images - <a href="https://www.pexels.com">Pexels Free Stock Photos</a></ul>
<ul>Icons - <a href="https://www.flaticon.com">Flat Icon: Free Vector Icons</a></ul>

<h2>Web resources</h2>
<p>Besides, the resources from this page have also been imported from open sources:</p>
<ul>Web style - <a href="https://github.com/jekyller/jasper2">Jekyll Jasper 2 Theme</a></ul>

<h1>Projects</h1>
Projects fall under a different category. As they have been developed thoroughfully, and in order to provide full resources of it, they display a list of all the sources used.

<p>If you think any of the resources used is inappropiate, dishonest, fraudulent, misleading or might attempt against anything or anyone, please contact me and we'll sort it out somehow!</p>
