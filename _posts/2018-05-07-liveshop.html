<p>Imagine going shopping online. Now imagine doing it live, being able to ask details of the product to the seller. Or to try it out from your sofa.</p>

<p>Live shop is a concept for this new way of business.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p>All images and icons in this concept come from a <a href="http://pexels.com/">free stock source</a>. As this is part of a <a href="http://99designs.com/">99Designs</a> contest, the logo and any other visual material used for the design were provided, therefore I do not own them. The concepts are used only for personal promotion purposes (non-commercial intentions).</p>
