<p>James is a mobile app to find trusted and verified professionals who provide a wide range of services from babysitting, to housekeeping or private teachers.</p>

<p>The interface shows all the services provided by pro freelancers, immediately contractable via the app. Just select what you need. All the information about the worker (even the area on which they work) is displayed. Prices and discounts are immediately applied. Easy as 1, 2, 3! (actually, also 4).

Whenever. Wherever. Just a few taps away! </p>
