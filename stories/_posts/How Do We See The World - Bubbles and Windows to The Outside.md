How Do We See The World - Bubbles and Windows to The Outside
It's interesting how much our environment affects our perception with a single delicate touch. We assume the world based on this tune.
How's our perception of our surroundings nowadays? 
Some days life beautiful…
Let's take a quick look at the world:
We have inequality. Violation of rights. Thefts, corruption and illegalities all around. Hunger. Lies and conspirations. People hate each other. We only aim to destroy and step on others to reach the top. Several iniquities we experience every day.
And a long list which has been nicely summarised by Kaanchi Chopra in the reimagined Periodic Table.
But let me switch the speech up all over.
Poverty has been largely reduced in this century. Human rights are defended more than ever. Diseases become curable and have a reduced death rate. We all seem to be more open to lend a hand and help. Not to mention politics. Seriously. Better not. This is a modest appeal to optimism.
Just by reading the list of solutions above you might feel slightly cheered up.
Just by reading the first list of problems at the beginning you might feel suddenly crushed by the heaviness they connote. But how many of the whole list are you exposed to at the moment? Even further, how many of those do you actually happen to feel in your bones these days?
I found myself surprised reading the table and not have even taken some elements in consideration. Much more shocked when I could not even identify some.
If we do not see or experience a problem in our environment, we tend to overlook its existence. It's just hard to imagine in our current context.

Just imagine 
It's hard to think about pollution - Ar (18) or Argon according to Chopra's table- when you spend a nice sunny day by the river hearing fluffy birds sing around, isn't it?
Or child labour - Cl (17) or Chlorine- when you see them catching butterflies, running barefoot in the park. (Kids, don't do this at home.)
These sensations act as local mirages.
It's just how we've unconsciously wired our brains, otherwise it'd be extremely stressful to pay attention to and care about each. It would be like fighting 90 battles at 90 different fronts.
If we take a closer look, we seem to be exempt of some/most of these issues. They do happen, of course, but not to us.
It's just like a rain cloud.
We know rain exists as we have seen/felt it before. But we become aware of showers when we get wet.
The positive part here is that problems, just like clouds, are unlikely to happen everywhere at the same time. That feeling of "things are going wrong/right" feels so widespread, so world-wide, when in fact it happens in our close range. In our bubble.

Bubbles
This is about building our reality based on our perception. Quite similar to isolation bubbles, yeah, but that's not the intention. At least fully.
Generally, living in your own bubble would mean refusing to update your information about the surrounding world. You are familiar with the circles you know and trust, and cannot see beyond - we'll discuss this later too.
This is highly similar. But with some experience added.
We might know - as a result of checking your circles-  that people can be unkind. But if you see a lady dropping an apple, and the man behind her quickly picks it up, draws her attention and returns it to her, one can quickly find again a glimpse of hope and rewrite one's inner perception about unkindness. For a little while, kindness has replaced it. Even healed. Maybe it has even shifted the balance to a more promising feeling.
Rewriting. Which can be either restoring or shattering.
Lots of news headlines can increase our confidence in the fact that overall standards of living are rising. They restore. But the picture changes when your neighbour had a work in the black economy and has just lost it, with no rights or hope. These shatter.
This is living in our own bubble. Not isolated, nor being kept apart from society. Just in our own familiar environment where we sense, see, interact and do. Take it as a bathtub with many bubbles
We cannot embrace the full spectrum of facts happening all around the world to build an overall view of an issue. Spoiler here: there are in fact any blacks and whites in our story - world is not either "going terribly wrong" or "extremely well". Most likely we'll encounter middle-grounds or greys.
If kindness happens on one side of the Earth, unkindness may be happening on the opposite side. Or right next door!
All we can do is average on what's within our range, build our own perception. Then feel and act consequently.

Windows to the outside
How are we measuring that average on which we base our preception then?
Imagine you're a horse. Just for a moment.
Equine vision is said to have one of the largest vision field amongst the mammalians, although only the front view is binocular. Blinkers - physical sight range restrictors - are commonly used to avoid the animal being distracted or panicked by the surroundings. Therefore, they're somehow forced to focus on what's in front of them.
You can get back to be you now if you want. 
When we see the reality in our own range, we are looking at a small sample of the total. And the contained cases might include the best version of the truth. Or the worst look of our fears.
Depict a scenario where each and every person you encounter - just by chance - does the exactly the same action: let's say they make their own soap home. And people in magazines, the habits of y our favourite character in your current Netflix series, maybe it's also written on the stars, basically wherever you might look, you see everyone making their own soap too. Then, generally, in your bubble, people make their own soap home cause all your windows show you that reality.
"Wherever you might look" representationThis of course can be a matter of chance. You might not have encountered people who buy soap. 
How our windows are limited not only by pure chance but also by the information we're constrained to - controlled by a third-party or simply by our personal taste - shall be largely complicated in an intricate tangle of interconnections, which even the most experienced professionals would fear and fail at deciphering.
Call it seeing one side of the prism.
Call it we are - locally -  biased.
Call it we are horses.
Whatever sounds better to you.
"What your windows see" vs. Reality representation

This might be the curse of generalisation. A double-edged weapon which can make hope fade a little bit more. Or still glue back our shattered perception of reality.
This is where proper - carefully checked - information, holding back fear when exploring the unknown and embracing the diversity - of thought, of perception, of any kind - , all combined, open our windows and make our bubbles a bit more accurate. Or at least aware.
